tags: chicken, Asian

ingredients:
- 1 lb of chicken breasts
- 3 tbsp of butter
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 1/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1/3 cup honey

directions:
- Cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise.
- Melt the butter in a skillet on medium heat.
- Place the chicken breasts in the butter and cook on one side until they get golden-brown, about 5-6 minutes.
- Combine the vinegar, soy sauce, and honey in a bowl and set aside.
- When the chicken has been cooking for about 3-4 minutes, add the garlic in the skillet. If necessary, add another 1/2 tbsp of butter first. Cook the garlic for about 1 minute.
- Add the sauce to the skillet.
- The chicken should be ready to flip a minute or two after the sauce goes into the skillet. Cook the chicken for another 4-5 minutes and remove it from the skillet.
- Keep simmering the sauce until it gets close to your desired thickness. Note that the sauce will thicken some more as it cools!
