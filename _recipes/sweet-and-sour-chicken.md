tags: chicken, Asian

ingredients:
- 1 large chicken breast (not really sure about this one)
- 1 bell pepper
- 6 tbsp ketchup
- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 3/4 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 cup and 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp garlic salt
- 3/4 tsp onion powder
- 1 1/2 tbsp corn starch (plus enough corn starch to coat the chicken pieces)
- 3 tbsp cold water

directions:
- Cut the chicken into ~1" pieces.
- Coat the chicken pieces in corn starch and shake off the excess.
- Heat enough vegetable oil (or other frying oil) to cover the bottom of a large skillet about 1/2" - 1" deep, on medium heat. 
- Cook the chicken pieces in the oil until golden brown.
- Cut the pepper into strips or 1" squares and saut√© with olive oil over medium heat until tender.
- While the chicken and pepper are cooking, combine the rest of the ingredients except for the corn starch and cold water in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.
- When the sauce begins to boil, combine the cold water and corn starch. Mix it together well, and then add it to the sauce.
- Bring the sauce back up to a boil, and then let it simmer until it reaches your desired thickness.
