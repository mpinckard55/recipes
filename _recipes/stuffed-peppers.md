tags: ground beef, peppers

ingredients:
- 2 bell peppers
- 3/4 lb ground beef
- 1 14oz. can diced tomatoes
- 1/3 cup rice or 1/2 cup quinoa
- 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, plus more for topping
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1/2 tsp dried basil
- 1/2 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp pepper

directions:
- Cut out the stem and membranes of the peppers, leaving enough of a ridge at the top to hold in the stuffing. Cut the peppers in half lengthwise and remove the seeds.
- Boil the peppers for 3 minutes. Salt the peppers and allow them to dry while preparing the rest of the ingredients for baking.
- Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.
- Brown the beef in a large skillet and drain off the fat.
- Add the tomatoes, rice/quinoa, Worcestershire, water, and seasonings to the beef. Bring it to a boil, cover it, and allow it to simmer until the rice/quinoa is cooked, about 15-20 minutes.
- Add the 1/4 cup of cheddar to the mixture and then scoop into the pepper halves.
- Place the peppers in a greased baking dish and bake for about 15 minutes.
- Turn off the oven. Sprinkle additional cheddar cheese on the peppers and place back into the oven for about 5 minutes while it's cooling to melt the cheese.
