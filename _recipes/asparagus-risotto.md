tags: risotto, asparagus, vegetable

ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups arborio rice
- 1 qt chicken stock
- 1/2 cup white wine
- 1 medium shallot, chopped
- 3 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1/2 lb asparagus, cut into 1" pieces
- 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
- 2 tbsp Italian parsley

directions:
- Heat the stock to a simmer in a medium saucepan, then lower the heat so that it just stays hot.
- In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil and 1 tbsp of the butter over medium heat. 
- When the butter has melted, add the shallot. Cook until soft and slightly translucent, about 2-3 minutes.
- Add the arborio rice to the pot and stir it briskly with a wooden spoon so that the grains are coated with the oil and melted butter. Cook for another minute or so, until there is a slightly nutty armoa, but don't let the rice turn brown.
- Add the wine and cook while stirring, until the liquid is fully absorbed.
- Add a ladle of chicken stock to the rice and stir until the liquid is fully absorbed. 
- Continue adding chicken stick one ladle at a time, stirring constantly and adding each ladle of stock only once the previous stock has been fully absorbed. 
- Keep going until the rice is tender but stil firm to the bite. If you run out of stock, you can finish with water.
- About 15 minutes into this process, add the asparagus.
- Stir in the remaining 2 tbsp of butter, the parmesan, and the parsley, and season to taste with kosher salt.
