tags: cookies, dessert

ingredients:
- 1 cup unsalted butter, melted and then cooled for at least 5 minutes.
- 1 1/2 cups (packed) light brown sugar
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 2 eggs, room temperature
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp cornstarch
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

directions:
- Stir together the butter and sugars in a large bowl.
- Add the eggs one at a time, stirring until combined.
- Stir in the vanilla extract and maple syrup.
- In a separate bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients (minus the chocolate).
- Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until completely combined.
- Stir in the chocolate chips.
- Cover the bowl and allow to chill for at least 30 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and prepare cookie sheets by lining with parchment paper.
- Scoop about 2-3 tbsp of cookie dough and roll it into a ball, making them slightly taller than they are wide. Place them at least 2" apart on the cookie sheets.
- Bake for about 13 minutes (cookies will appear to be slightly underdone, but the edges should be just beginning to turn golden brown).
- Allow the cookies to cool completely on the cookie sheet.
