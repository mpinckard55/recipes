title: "Balsamic Glazed Salmon"
# image:
tags: fish, salmon

ingredients:
- 4 salmon filets (in the original recipe... but we like to double the glaze and use only 2 or 3 fillets...)
- 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp and 1 tsp brown sugar (packed)

directions:
- Combine the vinegar, water, lemon juice, and brown sugar in a bowl and stir until sugar is dissolved.
- Bring the glaze to a boil in a skillet, then reduce heat to medium/medium-low and let it simmer until it reaches desired thickness. Keep in mind that the glaze will continue to thicken as it cools. If you simmer it too long it WILL become balsamic candy!
- While the glaze is simmering, season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Put them on an oiled baking sheet and broil them for about 7 minutes.
