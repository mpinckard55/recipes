tags: chicken, Asian, stir fry

ingredients (lo mein):
- 4-6 oz lo mein noodles or uncooked ramen noodles
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 2-3 cups vegetables, julienned or chopped
- 1-2 tbsp mirin (may substitute cooking sherry, rice wine, or similar)

ingredients (sauce):
- 3 tbsp soy sauce (ideally 2 tbsp dark and 1 tbsp light)
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp sugar

directions:
- Shake all the sauce ingredients together in a jar.
- Cook the noodles according to the package directions. Cook and set aside.
- Heat the sesame oil for the lo mein in a large wok or skillet.
- Add the vegetables to the hot pan and stir fry until fork tender, about 5 minutes.
- Add the mirin to deglaze the pan. 
- Add the cooked noodles and the sauce. Technically you should only need about 1/2 - 3/4 of the sauce, but really we like it with all the sauce.
