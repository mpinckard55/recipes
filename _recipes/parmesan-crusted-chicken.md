title: "Parmesan-Crusted Chicken"
# image:
tags: chicken

ingredients:
- 1 1/4 lbs. thinly cut chicken breasts
- 1 sprig fresh rosemary, finely minced
- 1 cup grated parmesan cheese
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup bread crumbs (original recipe specifically says panko)
- Olive oil for frying

directions:
- Lay the chicken breasts out on a cutting board and season them generously on both sides with salt and pepper. Set aside.
- Set out three bowls, one with the parmesan, another with the eggs, and the third with bread crumbs.
- Whisk the rosemary with the eggs until combined.
- Heat a large skillet over medium heat.
- Dip each chicken cutlet into the parmesan, the egg, and the bread crumbs, in that order. Shake off the excess (or let it drip) of each ingredient.
- When the pan is nice and hot, add enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan, about 2-3 tbsp. Add 2 or 3 cutlets at a time to the hot oil and cook for 4-5 minutes per side, until golden and crispy.
